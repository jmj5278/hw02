Homework 2

This is homework2 focusing on the 'dplyr' and 'ggplot2' package by using GSW shot charts.

By using the 'ggplot2' package, we will create the shot charts adding a background with the image of basketball court.

Also, through the 'dplyr' package, we will analyze the total shots by players and shooting distance. 

Homework2 will provide more experience on creating a file struture and those packages.
